# Meadmaking-Info
# Necessities
- 3 LBS honey Per 1 Gallon of mead
- 1 Packet of yeast per 5 gallon batch of mead (use 1 packet even for smaller batches)
- 2 glass jugs/carboys (One for fermenting, one to remove mead from dead yeast as part of the process)
- 1 airlock w/ a bung to fit in jug/carboy
- Raisins (not strictly a necessity, but your yeasties need nutrients!)
- Sanitizer or cleanser. 
  - "Sanitizer" is usually touted as required, but OneStep Cleanser will almost certainly suffice for everything.
  - Starsan Sanitizer
  - OneStep Cleanser (This is what i use every time)
- Buckets to sanitize stuff in
- A Siphon or sterile pump of some sort for racking/bottling.


## Getting Started - tutorials
- [Storm The Castle - Make Mead Easily and Successfully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ueyNQfnfE)
  - A good video showing a no-frills/easy way to make some mead with a high chance of it turning out pretty good
- [Joe's Ancient Orange Mead Recipie](https://gotmead.com/blog/recipe/joes-ancient-orange-clove-and-cinnamon-mead/)
  - A excellent instructional for making a good spiced mead that will taste pretty good "young" (so you're not stuck aging it for 1-2 years. You could also age it for 1-2 years if you like)
  - Even if you don't follow this recipie or follow an altered version, it's good at illustrating how you can make mead without too much of the "Science" aspect. I find it's best not to get too clinical too early in the learning process.

  - No clinicians necessary. Spontaneous fermentation using wild yeasts and natural/organic ingredients. A bit "harder" than basic mead making, with more chances for stuff to go wrong. Takes longer. Good for an adventure/learning experience.
